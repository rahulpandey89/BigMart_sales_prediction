then it will search for parameter values which increases the accuracy of model.So some details about problems are
•The goal is to find item sale at Outlet of different types & located at different locations.
•It includes task such as data visualization, cleaning and transformation,feature engineering.
•Python is used as programming language and Jupyter Notebook is used as tools.
